I built Bomberman multiplayer with four other classmates for our final project. I wrote the networking code, security (AES encryption), the SQL database connector (and created the table on the workbench), some of the java swing GUIs (start screan, login, signup, customize, and game lobby screens). It was a really fun project (if you want to play or host on your machine change the ip in the server and client files to be that of your router)
